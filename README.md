## Abstract

Blockchain technologies use has increasingly become a part of daily life, especially due to its role in financial services like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Despite being promoted as alternative services that challenge more traditional ones by being transparent and decentralized, high profile fraud cases have led to growing concern about the safety of these technologies for the average individual who decides to invest. Moreover, research over time has shown that these technologies have high rates of energy consumption, leading to questions about their environmental impact. BV is being proposed as a platform that plans to offer users easy access to Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction information, in order to increase the transparency of these blockchains. BV also plans to use the data to estimate and show users the energy consumption of these blockchains in order to raise awareness of their environmental impact.

### BV is an undergraduate graduation project
