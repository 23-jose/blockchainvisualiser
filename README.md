## Abstract
Initially conceptualized in 2008, blockchain technologies quickly gained traction especially in the financial sector. Because of this, they are now ubiquitous in the world of decentralized finance mainly through their role as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Promising more transparency and liquidity than traditional financial assets, blockchains quickly became an area of interest for many. However, as of 2025, the momentum of blockchain technologies has subsided due not only to the emergence of AI, but also due to high profile financial fraud cases tied to them, and concerns over their environmental impact. Blockchain Visualiser (BV) was proposed in March of this year as a platform that would offer its users easy access to Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction and energy consumption data to increase the transparency of these blockchains and raise awareness of their environmental impact.
